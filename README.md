3. The application will retrieve the learner information, calculate the average score, and display it on the webpage.

Sample Data:
The sample data includes information about courses, assignment groups, and learner submissions. It is provided within the `script.js` file and used for testing the application's functionality.

Functionality:
- The application validates input data to ensure consistency and correctness.
